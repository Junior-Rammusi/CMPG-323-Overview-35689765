**#The Branching Stategy**

For each project,the Gitflow branching model will be used.When there is a bug that needs to be fixed this branching strategy will make it easier to fix the bug before megging back to the main branch and deploying it. This strategy is effective because it does and will not affect the main branch from the repository  
  

**#The .GitIgnore file**

The.gitignore file is a configuration file used in Git repositories to indicate which files and directories should be ignored by the version control system. When you commit changes to a Git repository, only the files and directories that Git tracks are included in the commit. The.gitignore file allows you to set patterns for files that Git should ignore, preventing them from being added to the repository even if they exist in the repository.    
Project 1 - No .gitignore file is needed.  
Project 2 - Will use the .gitignore file.  
Project 3 - Will use the .gitignore file.  
Project 4 - Will use the .gitignore file.   
Project 5 - Will use the .gitignore file.  

**#The Storage and Credentials and Sensetive Information**

For security concerns, sensitive data cannot be saved on the disc. Data protection from both inside and outside the world is vital.Data storage should be encrypted with an encryption that can be decoded back to plain text. When it comes to excellent data storage, having a single copy of a file is not a good thing since if the file is lost, there is no way to recover it, but storing numerous copies of an encrypted file might be useful.
